    The _AspNetCoreAppSharedFxIsEnabled property is meant for internal use only. When set to 'false',
    the default value of MicrosoftNETPlatformLibrary will be used. It was added to support
    a better SDK exprience on platforms where the ASP.NET Core shared framework is not avaiable.

    NB: this is _AspNetCore*App*SharedFxIsEnabled, not _AspNetCore*All*SharedFxIsEnabled
